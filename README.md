# Object-Counter
## Motivation
In this project we will train a deep neural network such that the number of oranges in a picture are correctly determined.
The user can then upload a picture of oranges as part of validation. The project targets the following scenarios:

* Number of oranges in a plain background.
* Number of oranges in a complex background.
* Number of oranges amongst other objects.

We will finally explore whether the model can be used to count other objects.
