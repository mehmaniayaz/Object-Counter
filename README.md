# Object-Counter
## Motivation
In this project, we are interested in building a neural network model that counts the number of objects in a picture. 
The user can gather their own images with a cell phone and augment them with the pipeline discussed in this project. Currently, we have focused 
on oranges in a relatively plain background. The project can be extended to incorporate more complex backgrounds and 
mixture of objects.
